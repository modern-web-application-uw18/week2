# React-JS3-SocialNetwork

This repository holds my first React project implemented in my Javascript Certification course.

This React app recapitulates a Medium page and so practices creating components, taking in a JSON file and binding the data to the respective card components. 

I received 94% out  of 100 for this assignment. I received partial credit for my tests, as I was still learning to implement them correctly.

There are many oppertunities for learning with this assignment:

1) Make each card/article clickable
2) Create a bookmark icon and upon a click event the icon changes color. A second click changes the state back to transaprent.
3) Attach this to an API to fetch newer articles
